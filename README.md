# cathanvas-engine
Project for experimenting with game engine prototypes. Initially written for the game of Snake. Also added Tetris and Dungeon Crawling versions.

This game engine is created using Javascript, the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), and no external libraries.
